The file "MIR_Fruit_Purees.csv" contains a collection of 983 Mid-infrared spectra collected from different authenticated fruit purees in one of two classes: "Strawberry" (purees prepared from fresh whole fruits by the researchers) and "NON-Strawberry" (diverse collection of other purees, including: strawberry adulterated with other fruits and sugar solutions; raspberry; apple; blackcurrant; blackberry; plum; cherry; apricot; grape juice and mixtures of these.

Spectra were acquired from each puree using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling.  The acquisition order was randomized with respect to sample type. 

The data are described in more detail in the journal paper "Use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and partial least squares regression for the detection of adulteration of strawberry purees" Holland JK, Kemsley EK, Wilson RH. (1998). Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 76, 263-269
